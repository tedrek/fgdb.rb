Hello <%= @myworker.name %>,

According to the database, you were scheduled to work on the following
days but didn't log any hours:
<% @myworker.dates.each do |x| -%>
 <%= x %>
<% end -%>

If you are at Free Geek, you can use the following links to log your
hours for these days:
<% @myworker.dates.each do |x| -%>
 <%= url_for(:host => "data", :controller => "worked_shifts", :action => "", :worked_shift => {:worker_id => @myworker.worker_id, :date_performed => x}, :escape => false) %>
<% end -%>

Please go to the above links and log your hours.

If you didn't really work on that day or if you can't make it in to
log your hours, submit a request for the schedule to be changed at:
http://todo.freegeek.org/schedule

Sincerely,
The database
