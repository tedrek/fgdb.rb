<h2>
Tech Support Important Information</h2>
</center>
 We provide free technical support on systems during the stipulated warranty period, provided that the original operating system (Xubuntu 12.04 or Ubuntu 10.04*) is still installed; and no major changes to the hardware have been made, Store bought systems are warrantied for 6 months (this does not apply to servers, non-Intel Macs, XBMC and Gaming Rigs - all of which are not covered by Tech Support). <br/>
<br/>
 After the original warranty period has elapsed, items will be supported on a pay-as-you-go basis for $10 an issue for 1 year - replacement hardware costs are extra. We can only help solve your tech support issues if the original operating system that came with your machine is still installed. Any systems which fall outside of the times listed above beyond this will be dealt with only at our discretion.  <center>
